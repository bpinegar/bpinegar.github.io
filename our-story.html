    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <h2>Where it all began...</h2>
    <p>You know that song by Rihanna, "We Found Love?" Of course you do. It was only played on the radio non-stop for 8 months. Anyways, there is one line from the chorus that truly epitomizes the origin of our relationship: "We found love in a hopeless place." What was that hopeless place you ask? A company called TIG Global - the first company each of us worked for right out of college.</p>
    <p>By the time Caitlin was hired in September of 2009, Ben had been at TIG for over a year. At one point, during a work happy hour, Caitlin (a Duke grad) and Ben (a Maryland grad) got into a lively debate about which of their alma maters had a better basketball program. Said debate culminated when Caitlin slapped Ben in the face for saying something mean about Coach K. According to him, it was "love at first slap." That said, it still took a while for our relationship to develop - partially because Ben is a ‘doofus’ when it comes to girls and didn’t know how to make a move.</p>
    <p>Flash forward to St. Patrick's Day 2010. Ben, Caitlin, and a bunch of other friends from TIG Global headed out to celebrate their inner-Irishman at a Mexican restaurant called Cactus Cantina, naturally. After a few (pitchers of) margaritas, the party moved to the apartment of a friend, where the boys in the group promptly started playing Rock Band. Unmoved by one of Ben's epic ballads, Caitlin informed him that she and another coworker were going to head to another bar, The Blaguard (actually an Irish bar). Ben decided to tag along, and Caitlin and Ben spent the next hour only talking to each other. Ben finally got the nerve up to admit that he may have had a thing for her for the past six months (since that October happy hour, to be specific), and asked if she wanted to go out to dinner some time.</p>
    <h2>The first date...</h2>
    <p>The week after that St. Patrick’s Day happy hour, Ben and Caitlin went on their first date to Raku, a sushi restaurant in Bethesda. Ben’s proudest moment of this date was when he proposed that they split the sea urchin appetizer. Caitlin skeptically agreed, but made sure that Ben tried his first. Let’s just say that he had his poker face on, and completely led Caitlin to believe that it was incredibly delicious. Well, it was not incredibly delicious. In fact, it had the texture of boogers (or so I would imagine) and to this day remains the grossest food that Caitlin (who is not a picky eater) can ever remember eating. As for Caitlin’s reaction, just picture Tom Hanks in BIG.</p>
    <p>Ben begged for his forgiveness, and the rest of the night was filled with lively conversation and banter, leaving both Ben and Caitlin with the feeling that they had been dating for much longer than just that night. And as they say, the rest is history.</p>
    <h2>The proposal...</h2>
    <p>Four and a half years later, Ben proposed to Caitlin on a Monday night in late September, after Caitlin returned home from a work trip in New York. The weekend leading up to the proposal, Ben and Caitlin had a fabulous weekend, doing nothing special in particular. But it just felt different to Caitlin. They cooked an elaborate brunch, took a walking tour of city, complete with some spontaneous stops to have delicious cocktails at places they had never been, and ate dinner on the steps of the portrait gallery.</p>
    <p>That Sunday afternoon, Caitlin left for New York, and had dinner with two friends that night. During this dinner, she recounted her fun weekend, and her friend Tyler stated, “hmm, I bet he’s planning something!”</p>
    <p>Well, Tyler was right, because right after Caitlin left for New York, Ben was off shopping, buying D.C. fresh out of candles. He purchased about 150-200 candles, to be exact, along with champagne, dark chocolate, dark chocolate covered bacon, and the fixin’s for homemade dark chocolate covered strawberries. If Ben has learned anything from the 4.5 years he had been dating Caitlin, it was that dark chocolate is the way to her heart.</p>
    <p>Around 10:00 pm that night, Caitlin arrived home to an apartment full of candles, and a suit-clad boyfriend ready to ask her to spend the rest of her life with him. She said yes, obviously!</p>
