    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <h2>Where it all began...</h2>
    <p>You know that song by Rihanna, "We Found Love?" Of course you do. It was only played on the radio non-stop for 8 months. Anyways, there is one line from the chorus that truly epitomizes the origin of our relationship: "We found love in a hopeless place." What was that hopeless place you ask? A company called TIG Global - the first company each of us worked for right out of college.</p>
    <p>By the time Caitlin was hired in September of 2009, Ben was pretty much a veteran employee, having been at TIG for over a year (a rare feat, seemingly). At one point in October, at a happy hour following a company meeting, Caitlin (a Duke grad) and Ben (a Maryland grad) got into a lively debate about which of their alma maters had a better basketball program. Said debate culminated when Caitlin slapped Ben in the face for saying something mean about Coach K. According to him, it was "love at first slap." That said, it still took a while for our relationship to develop - mostly because Ben is a ‘doofus’ when it comes to girls and didn’t know how to make a move.</p>
    <p>Flash forward to St. Patrick's Day 2010. We, along with a bunch of other friends from TIG Global headed out to celebrate our inner-Irishman at a Mexican restaurant called Cactus Cantina, naturally. After a few (pitchers of) margaritas, the party moved to the apartment of a friend, where the boys in the group promptly started playing Rock Band. Unmoved by one of Ben's epic ballads, Caitlin informed him that she and another coworker were going to head to another bar, The Blaguard (actually an Irish bar). Ben decided to tag along, and we spent the next hour only talking to each other (Ben even bought Caitlin a beer, how romantic). Ben finally got the nerve up to admit that he may have had a thing for her for the past six months (since that October happy hour), and asked if she wanted to go out to dinner some time.</p>
    <h2>The first date...</h2>
    <p>The week after St. Patrick’s Day, we went on our first date to Raku, a sushi restaurant in Bethesda. Ben’s proudest moment of this date was when he proposed that they split the sea urchin appetizer. Caitlin skeptically agreed, but made sure that Ben tried his first. Let’s just say that he had his poker face on, and completely led her to believe that it was incredibly delicious. Well, it was not incredibly delicious. It had the texture of boogers and to this day remains the grossest food that Caitlin (who is not a picky eater) can ever remember eating. As for her reaction, just picture Tom Hanks in <i>BIG</i>.</p>
    <p>Ben begged for her forgiveness, and the rest of the night was filled with lively conversation and banter, leaving both of us with the feeling that we had been dating for much longer than just that night. And as they say, the rest is history.</p>
    <h2>The proposal...</h2>

    <p>Four and a half years later, Ben proposed to Caitlin when she returned home from a work trip one Monday night in late September. The weekend leading up to the proposal, we had a fabulous weekend, doing nothing special in particular. But it just felt different to Caitlin. We cooked an elaborate brunch for no reason, took a walking tour of the city, (complete with some spontaneous stops for delicious cocktails at places they had never been), and ate dinner on the steps of the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
    <p>Sunday afternoon, Caitlin left for her work trip in New York. That night she had dinner with two friends, during which she recounted her fun weekend. Her friend, Tyler, wise beyond her years, confidently stated, “I bet he’s planning something!”</p>
    <p>Well, Tyler was right. Right after Caitlin left for New York, Ben was off shopping - buying D.C. fresh out of candles. He purchased over 200 candles, along with champagne, dark chocolate, dark chocolate covered bacon (for himself), and all the fixin’s for homemade dark chocolate covered strawberries (i.e. dark chocolate & strawberries). If Ben has learned anything from the 4.5 years he has been dating Caitlin, it’s that dark chocolate is the way to her heart.</p>
    <p>Around 10:00 pm that night, Caitlin arrived home to an apartment full of candles and a suit-clad boyfriend ready to ask her to spend the rest of her life with him. She said yes, obviously. And Ben was just happy that her train had been on time - apparently he hadn't thought through that lighting 200 candles in a 700 square foot apartment might makes things a little toasty!</p>
