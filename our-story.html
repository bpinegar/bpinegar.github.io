    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>You know that song by Rihanna, "We Found Love?" Of course you do. It was only played on the radio non-stop for 8 months. Anyways, there is one line from the chorus that truly epitomizes the origin of our relationship: "We found love in a hopless place." That hopless place, was a company named TIG Global (which eventually became Micros e-Commerce which eventually became Oracle Systems) - the first company each of us worked for right out of college.</p>
    <p>By the time Caitlin was hired in September of 2009, Ben had been at TIG for just over a year and was pretty much running the place (slight exaggeration). Given that Ben was the "Senior Web Marketing Analyst" (whatever that means) on the team and Caitlin was an intern, Ben liked to refer to Caitlin as "his intern," much to Caitlin's dismay. Of course, this didn't start happening until after they started dating, which took many, many months because Ben is a doofus when it come to talking to girls.</p>
    <p>Flash forward to St. Patrick's Day 2010. Ben, Caitlin, and a bunch of other friends from TIG Global headed out to celebrate their inner-Irishman - naturally, the night started off at a Mexican restaurant, Cactus Cantina. After a few (pitchers of) margaritas, the party moved to the apartment of a friend, where the boys in the group promptly started playing Rock Band. Unmoved by one of Ben's epic ballads, Caitlin informed him that her and another coworker were going to head to another bar, THE BLAGUARD.</p>
