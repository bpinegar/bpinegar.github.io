    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <h2>Where it all began...</h2>
    <p>You know that song by Rihanna, "We Found Love?" Of course you do. It was only played on the radio non-stop for 8 months. Anyways, there is one line from the chorus that truly epitomizes the origin of our relationship: "We found love in a hopless place." What was that hopeless place you ask? A company named TIG Global (which eventually became Micros e-Commerce which eventually became Oracle Systems) - the first company each of us worked for right out of college.</p>
    <p>By the time Caitlin was hired in September of 2009, Ben had been at TIG for over a year. Nothing really happened at first - partially because Ben is a doofus when it comes to girls.</p>
    <p>Flash forward to St. Patrick's Day 2010. Ben, Caitlin, and a bunch of other friends from TIG Global headed out to celebrate their inner-Irishman - naturally, the night started off at a Mexican restaurant, Cactus Cantina. After a few (pitchers of) margaritas, the party moved to the apartment of a friend, where the boys in the group promptly started playing Rock Band. Unmoved by one of Ben's epic ballads, Caitlin informed him that she and another coworker were going to head to another bar, THE BLAGUARD.</p>
    <h2>The first date...</h2>

    <h2>The next 4 years...</h2>
    <p>blah blah blah</p>
    <h2>The proposal...</h2>
    <p>blah blah blah</p>
