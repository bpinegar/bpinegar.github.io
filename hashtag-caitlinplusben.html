    <h1>#caitlinplusben</h1>
    <p>Do you spend hours poring over your Facebook feed every day? Do people routinely comment on how well composed your Instagrams are? Do you have more Twitter followers than Ben (which would be about 7)? Well, my friend, we want you to put those skills to use this fall. Any time you post something from one of our wedding events (not the bachelor party), be sure to use the hashtag <strong>#caitlinplusben</strong> so that we will be able to relive all of those (embarrassing) moments for years to come.</p>
    <p>Also, feel free to follow both of us on the accounts below!</p>
    <h2>Caitlin <i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> <i class="fa fa-instagram"> </i></h2>
    <h2>Ben <i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> <i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></h2>
    <p>Note: we both <i>have</i> Twitter, but it's not worth following us since neither of us have posted in years!</p>
