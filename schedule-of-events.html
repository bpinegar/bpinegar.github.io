    <h3>Wedding Ceremony</h3>

    <ul class="icon-list no-left-margin">
      <li class="li-icon li-location">Lonesome Valley<br>
        94 Lonesome Valley Road<br>
        Sapphire, North Carolina 28717
      </li>
      <li class="li-icon li-time">5:00 PM to 5:30PM</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ceremony will be held outdoors in the Valley at 5PM, weather permitting. Transportation to the ceremony will be provided from the official wedding hotels: High Hampton Inn & Country Club and Hampton Inn & Suites. Parking will also be available on-site.</p>
   <p><b>Attire:</b><br>Suit and tie or a fancy dress - you know, the stuff you usually wear to a wedding. If you want to wear a tux, feel free, but know that you will have to do a James Bond impression at some point during the night.</p>
    <p><b>Things to Keep in Mind:</b><br>
      The ceremony will be held in the grass, therefore ladies might want to consider wearing flats, wedges, or thick heels. It will likely be a little chilly, so do not be afraid to bring a pashmina, scarf, or jacket.
    </p>
