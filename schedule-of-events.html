    <p>The ceremony will be held outdoors in the Valley at 5PM, weather permitting. Transportation to the ceremony will be provided from the official wedding hotels: High Hampton Inn & Country Club and Hampton Inn & Suites. Parking will also be available on-site.</p>
    <p><b>Things to Keep in Mind:</b><br>
      The ceremony will be held in the grass, therefore ladies might want to consider wearing flats, wedges, or thick heels. It will likely be a little chilly, so do not be afraid to bring a pashmina, scarf, or jacket.
